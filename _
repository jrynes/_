/**
 * Checks the current route to determine if it is a login callback or a logout route.
 *
 * This method identifies special routes such as `/login/callback` or `/timeout-widget-logout`
 * and skips additional initialization for these routes. For other routes, it performs initialization
 * by verifying the Okta authentication state and completing user-related setup.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves after the appropriate checks and initialization.
 *
 * Key Steps:
 * 1. Resolves immediately for `/login/callback` and `/timeout-widget-logout` routes.
 * 2. For other routes, observes the Okta authentication state and initializes the application if needed.
 *
 * @example
 * this.checkLoginCallbackRoute().then(() => {
 *   console.log('Route check and initialization completed.');
 * }).catch((error) => {
 *   console.error('Error during route check:', error);
 * });

/**
 * Performs application initialization tasks for authenticated users.
 *
 * This method is responsible for:
 * - Broadcasting a "NEW_TAB" message.
 * - Checking the user's Okta session and silently re-authenticating if needed.
 * - Initializing user-specific data, feature configurations, and session timeout settings.
 *
 * @param {Observer<void>} observer - The observer used to notify when the initialization is complete.
 *
 * @returns {void}
 *
 * Key Steps:
 * 1. Verifies the user's authentication state and retrieves necessary tokens.
 * 2. Initializes session storage and broadcasts a message for new tab handling.
 * 3. Completes feature configuration and session timeout initialization.
 * 4. Signals completion via the provided observer.
 *
 * @example
 * const observer: Observer<void> = { next: () => {}, complete: () => {}, error: (err) => console.error(err) };
 * this.performInitialization(observer);

/**
 * Checks the user's authentication status with Okta and performs silent re-authentication if necessary.
 *
 * This method verifies if the user is currently authenticated. If not, it attempts silent authentication
 * to retrieve tokens without requiring user interaction. The retrieved tokens are then stored and used
 * for further operations.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves after the authentication check is complete.
 *
 * Key Steps:
 * 1. Uses `isAuthenticated` to check the user's current authentication state.
 * 2. If not authenticated, uses Okta's `getWithoutPrompt` method to attempt silent authentication.
 * 3. Stores the retrieved tokens (if any) in the Okta Token Manager.
 * 4. Handles errors gracefully if silent authentication fails.
 *
 * @example
 * this.checkOktaSession().then(() => {
 *   console.log('Session check completed successfully.');
 * }).catch((error) => {
 *   console.error('Error during session check:', error);
 * });
