/**
 * Host listener for the `window:focus` event to handle actions when the browser tab gains focus.
 *
 * This method is triggered whenever the browser window or tab is brought into focus.
 * It checks the session state, validates whether the session timeout modal is visible,
 * and ensures the user is still authenticated with Okta.
 *
 * @param {any} event - The focus event triggered by the browser.
 *
 * @returns {void}
 *
 * Key Steps:
 * 1. Determines if the session timeout modal is visible.
 * 2. Checks if the app is running outside the local DEV environment.
 * 3. If conditions are met, validates the user's session state with Okta.
 * 4. Redirects or logs out the user based on their session state.
 *
 * @example
 * // Automatically handled by Angular's @HostListener
 * <app-root></app-root>

/**
 * Checks if the session timeout modal is currently visible in the DOM.
 *
 * This method looks for a specific modal element (`#stmTimerContent`) and determines
 * if it is currently visible to the user.
 *
 * @returns {boolean} `true` if the modal is visible, `false` otherwise.
 *
 * Key Steps:
 * 1. Searches for the modal element in the DOM using its selector.
 * 2. Checks if the modal's `offsetParent` is non-null, indicating visibility.
 * 3. Logs the modal's visibility status to the console.
 *
 * @example
 * if (this.isSessionTimeoutModalVisible()) {
 *   console.log('Modal is visible');
 * }

/**
 * Handles browser tab focus and validates the user's session state.
 *
 * This method ensures that if the app is running in a non-local environment and the session
 * timeout modal is not visible, the user's session with Okta is checked. Depending on the
 * session state, it either redirects the user, logs them out, or performs no action.
 *
 * @returns {void}
 *
 * Key Steps:
 * 1. Verifies the app is running outside the local DEV environment.
 * 2. Checks if the session timeout modal is visible and if the user is anonymous.
 * 3. If conditions are met, checks the active session with Okta.
 * 4. Handles the session state:
 *    - If active: Redirects anonymous users with an active session to the home page.
 *    - If inactive: Logs out the user and redirects to the home page.
 * 5. Handles errors related to session validation.
 *
 * @example
 * this.handleTabFocus();
