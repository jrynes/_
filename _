/**
 * Intercepts HTTP requests and handles specific error scenarios such as rate limiting (429) and unauthorized access (401).
 *
 * This method ensures proper error handling for outgoing HTTP requests by:
 * - Displaying notifications for rate-limiting errors.
 * - Redirecting to a 401 error page for unauthorized access errors.
 * - Logging or processing error details for other error types.
 *
 * @param {HttpRequest<any>} request - The outgoing HTTP request.
 * @param {HttpHandler} next - The next handler in the HTTP pipeline.
 * @returns {Observable<HttpEvent<any>>} - The observable that handles the request and emits its events or errors.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * 1. **429 (Too Many Requests)**: Displays a toast notification to inform the user that the search limit has been reached.
 *    - Notification is removed automatically after 20 seconds.
 * 2. **401 (Unauthorized)**: Logs the error and redirects the user to the `/401` error page.
 * 3. **Blob Error Processing**: If the error body is a `Blob`, its JSON content is logged.
 * 4. **Other Errors**: Processes the error using a custom `processErrorJson` method.
 *
 * @example
 * // Usage in Angular's HTTP_INTERCEPTORS
 * {
 *   provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
 *   useClass: ErrorHandlingInterceptor,
 *   multi: true
 * }
 *
 * @throws {Error} Re-throws the error after processing it.
