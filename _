/**
 * Retrieves OIDC token information and updates authentication state in the application.
 *
 * This method listens to changes in the Okta authentication state and extracts details such as
 * the access token, ID token, and user authentication status. It also logs the refresh token and
 * updates user-specific information like the display name and authentication state.
 *
 * @returns {void}
 *
 * Key Steps:
 * 1. Subscribes to the `authState$` observable from `OktaAuthStateService` to listen for authentication changes.
 * 2. Filters for states where the user is authenticated.
 * 3. Maps the `authState` object to extract access token, ID token, and authentication status.
 * 4. Updates local properties such as `userName` and `isAuthenticated` based on the authentication state.
 * 5. Logs key information such as the refresh token for debugging purposes.
 *
 * @example
 * this.getOidcTokenInfo();
 * // Logs and updates:
 * // - Refresh token
 * // - Access token and ID token
 * // - User authentication status and display name
